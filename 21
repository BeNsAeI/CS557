Volkan:
- Derived from AMD's Mantle API
- Influenced by apples Metal API
- Less driver complexity and overhead
- Less user hand holding
- Higher single thread performance
- Multi-threaded graphics
- Handle tiled rendering

- Syncronization is programmers job not Volkan
- Events can be set, polled, and waited for
- Vulkan does not ever lock (programmers job)
- Threads can concurently read from the same object
- Threads can concurently write to different objects

in OpenGL:
- changing states are expensive
- changing colors are expensive
- uniform variables are expensive

* Shaders in Volkan follows GLSL specifications
- #define VULKAN 100
- Pre-Compiler compiles with external compiler
- Group uniform variables
- ...

GLSL Src -> Extern GLSL Compiler -> SPIR-V -> Compiler Driver -> Vendor-Specific-binary

___

WebGL: OpenGL-ES 2.0
- No fixed-function pipeling
- no glBegin glEnd
- No more builtin transformation functions
- Attributes are defined by attribute and not in
- in/out switched to varying
- Fragment shader must set percision 32 vs 64: percision highp float;
Sample: ~mjb/webgl
