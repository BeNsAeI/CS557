test is short answer
- Hmogeneus coordinates what means what are the y good for
 - x,y,z,w -> weight is for giving a multiplier for depth (x,y,z get divided by w)
 - in perspective it is used for depth
 - That is why it is a vec4
 - GL asserts it woun't be 0

- Model coordinate, eye/world coordinate, Screen

- Shader patterns:
 - Deciding what to key off of
 - Stripes: Keying off of x vs keying off of s
 - Stripes: Keying off of a quantity in Model Coordinatees vs. World/Eye Coordinate

- Noise
 - Cohearency and repeatability, why it can't be really random?
  - frame to frame changes
 - Position, Gradient, why we use gradient
 - Amplitude and frequency
 - Octave
 - "Turbulence"
 - How to use noise and why
 - GLMan's Noise baked into a look-up texture

- Fun with one: different ways to maniipulate the path from 0 to 1 
 - all equations for blending from one color to another in the pattern

- Goals of GLSL 1: speed, 2: quality
 - where does the compiler for graphics card sits -> driver
