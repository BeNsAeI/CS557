Dome projection using a vertex shader
- if the object is off in the distance, it shouldn't look different
- but when it comes closer, it needs to get bigger and bigger
- it never clips in x-y axis
- a large fish eye lense is needed
- could be used for maps that never clipp even when you zoom in
- R' = R/(R+K)
- x' = R'cos(theta)
- y' = R'sin(theta)
