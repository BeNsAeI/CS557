Tesselation:
- Inputs are same as the vertex shader and the most important one is gl_Position
- Outputs are parameters for primitive generator
- there is a layout for number of outputs:
 - layout (vertecies = 16) out; // number of vertecies to be handled
 - layout (pattern Generator Name, spacing parameter) out;
 - invocation id: which vertex is being affected
 -
