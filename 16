geometry shaders

- change geometry
- change topology

- Triangle parametrisation:
- vec3 v = V0 + s*V01 + t*V02

- Tessilation shader can reduce geometry
- For increasing performance

- Silh:
- look at the three sorrounding triangles
- if the normals are pointing to different directions on depth component (eye or reverse)
- it draws the line


Tessilation shader - Tessilation shader does what geommetry shader does but 
it has built in patterns
  to do it
- you can modify it based on where they are with regards to the model
-
