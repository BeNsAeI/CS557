- Use morph (mix or clamp) to turn your geometry to cube or sphere
 - Look at the code provided in glman -> CowMorph

- GLMan has a variable: Timer ( Uniform variable and it is float)
 - Define it in the shader file
 - GLMan sets the uniform variable

- Textures
 - Processed in Texture units (minimum of 16 for OpenGL, about 256 on average)
 - Texture units are numbered
 - Texture is handed to TU
 - TU's ID is passed to shader

- GLMan texture:
 - Texture2D 6 worldtex.bmp
 - TexUnit is a variable and pass 6:
  - TexUnit 6

- varying vec4 vColor
 - go through the rastorizer for frag shader
 - is deprecated
 - use out and in instead

- In fragment shader for texture:
 - float sf = fract (s * Frequency + OffsetS)
 - float tf = fract (t * Frequency + OffsetT)
 - uniform sampler2D TexUnit
 - vec3 newColor = texture2d(TexUnit, vec2(sf,tf) ).rgb; // you can also use texture
 - newColor = mix (newColor, vColor.rgb, Blend); 
 - gl_FragColor = vec4(vLightIntensity * newColor, 1.);

- In vertex shader:
 - out vec2 vST;
 - vST = gl_MultiTexCoord0.st
 - vLightIntesity = --;
 - vColor = --;

- Alpha value in frag still affects z buffer

Noise!
- Can be 1D, 2D or 3D
- Is a function of input values
- Ranges from -1 to +1 or from 0 to 1 (0 to 1 is openGL)
- Might look random, but really isn't
- Has continuity
- Is repeatable, same input always yeld same outputs

Positional Noise:
- Get positions and interpolate
- problem is not garaunteed t get + and - values

Gradient noise:
- or Perlin noise
- it picks all noise positions as 0 but at crossings it picks a slope
- or a gradient

Cubic or Quintic (fifth order) curves etc ...
- equations are at the slides: Noise.pptx

Noise Octaves:
- add multiple noise waves each one twice the frequency and half the amplitude 
  of the previous one
- could increase octaves dynamically to for finer grain and detail
- could be done in 1D , 2D and 3D

Use noise with discard function
- for spooky ghost or ash or crosion effeccts
