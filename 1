- Recall graphics pipeline
- shaders use the same pipeline (slightly modified)
- There are Fix functions and Programable elements
 - Vertex -> tessellation control -> geometry -> rasterizer -> fragment

- Homogeneous cordinates
 - w or weight, deviding by w:
  - x = x/w, y = y/w, z = z/w
 - it help us with doing perspective

- Note: In shader langugaes all vertecies are vec 4
- Normalize function -> turn a vector to a unit vector

- Get GLMan!
