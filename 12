Embossing filter
- looks like a paper punch

Edge detection:
- look for a rapid change in color or contrast
- Sobel filter

-     -1 -2 -1
- H =  0  0  0
-      1  2  1

-     -1  0  1
- v = -2  0  2
      -1  0  1

- S = sqrt(H^2+V^2)
- theta = atan2(|V|,|H|)
- this will give us large changes where edges are

Toon shading
- quantize color
- edge detect

Multi-pass rendering
- store into a texture instead of frame buffer
