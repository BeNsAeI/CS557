Scientific visualization
- In mulatipass rendering:
 - Negation will help with details showing up
 - embossing emphesises depth and details
 - Sharpenning will help spiking details
 - Edge detection will reduce data to emphesize edges
 - for arcitectural designs, toon shading is good

- Multi-data rendering
 - Sattlite data (up to 20 channels)
 - mix visible light, heat and water vapor

- Hyperbolic geometries
 - We will keep the contex

- Point cloud data
 - 3D textures
 - textures meant to be big, it gives us free interpolation
 - Jitter: taking each value and move it a small amount so they won't line up
 - discard uninteresting data
 - slice data set

*if(any (lessThan(vec3,vec3)))
*if(all (greaterThan(vec3,vec3)))
